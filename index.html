        <h4>Our Mission</h4>
        <p><strong>Presto</strong> is a program that aims to connect applicants of Prestigious Schools to the students that attend them. By doing so, we hope to grant applicants inside information about schools that interest them, find them assistance in writing applications, and build connections with future classmates!</p>
        <h4>Program Information</h4>
        <p><strong>Presto</strong> matches YOU with a similar student, based on your interests and background. This allows you to learn about the aspects of the schools that really interest you! When you are matched with a student, feel free to ask them any questions about the school, student body, teachers, or any other aspect of the school that you would like to know more about! One connection grants you access to a student for two months, and in those two months, you'll become familiar with your possible new home! But, don't be afraid to explore more than one school! <strong>Presto</strong> has access to students from many schools, so you can compare any school that interests you!</p>
